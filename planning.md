# Planning Document

## Static Site Generator Selection
We want to take these documents and eventually create a site at stl-polyglot-programmers.com using a static site generator.
We need to decide which one to go with.

What we'll do is make a list of possible candidates, then do a vote once we have the list.
As of writing this document, 2025-03-05, we will gather suggestions until the end of the month, 2025-03-31.
Please make PRs to this document for your suggestions.
