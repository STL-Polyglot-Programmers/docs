St. Louis Public Library would like to acknowledge the ancestral,
traditional and contemporary lands of the Osage, Kaskaskia, Kiikaapoi,
MÃ©tis, and other tribes where we are learning and working today. We
honor with gratitude the Indigenous peoples past and present who show
us, through their strength and resilience, our great responsibility
as stewards of the land. We appreciate the vast and often unrecognized
contributions of Indigenous people and are conscious of their ongoing
experiences of inequality.
